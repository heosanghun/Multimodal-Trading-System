- **Purpose**: Extract patterns and signals from candlestick chart images
- **Key Features**:
  - Image-based pattern recognition using CNN models
  - Generation of trading signals based on chart patterns
  - Integration with technical indicators

#### Sentiment Analyzer
- **Purpose**: Analyze news data to extract market sentiment
- **Key Features**:
  - Natural language processing for news sentiment analysis
  - Extraction of bullish/bearish keywords and signals
  - Time-series sentiment tracking and aggregation

#### Multimodal Fusion System
- **Purpose**: Integrate signals from different data sources (candlesticks, news, price)
- **Key Features**:
  - Attention-based fusion mechanisms
  - Transformer architecture for cross-modal interactions
  - Dynamic weighting of different signal sources

#### Reinforcement Learning Trader
- **Purpose**: Learn optimal trading policy through experience

   - Candlestick chart image generation
   - News data collection and preprocessing

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Candlestick pattern feature extraction using CNN
   - Sentiment feature extraction from news data
   - Technical indicator calculation from price data

3. **Signal Fusion**:
   - Multimodal fusion of candlestick, sentiment, and price signals
   - Attention-based weighting of different data sources
   - Generation of unified trading signals

4. **Decision Making**:
   - Trading strategy selection and execution
   - Position sizing and risk management
   - Order execution and monitoring

5. **Performance Evaluation**:
